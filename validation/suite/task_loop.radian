# This test does not work.
# I'm not sure whether it fails because the compiler is handling it wrong or
# because the test itself is invalid. This is a distinctly artificial use case,
# so it's hard to tell whether it should work. I'll take another look at it
# after I have a better developed main IO loop and some IO actions I can send
# out to it.
