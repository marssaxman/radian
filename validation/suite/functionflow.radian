# this little program exercises several important language features:
# - declaring functions and variables
# - invoking functions
# - functions can access context variables
# - if/else operator
# - comparison operator (greater than)
# - addition operator
# - generate a closure
# - invoke a closure
# - context variable captured at creation of closure ("lexical scope")
# We expect this program to return the value 61. 
# Failure of the if operator or the comparison might cause it to return 59.
# Failure of lexical scope might cause it to return 60.
# Other failures would probably show up as compilation errors.
