Radian's compiler and standard library make use of the Unicode character
definitions and some of its transformation algorithms. This directory contains
the current working copies of the Unicode data files and some scripts for
generating code or data files based on them.

If you want to upgrade to a newer version of Unicode, download the relevant
files, place them in this directory, then run the table generation scripts.
Once you're done, you'll need to commit everything: this is not a regular part
of the Radian build process, but something done on specific occasions. It should
be logged in the CHANGES file.
