Building Radian
===============

After you have cloned the source repository, you can download and install all
required libraries by executing ./make_devenv.sh. Libraries will be installed
in the subfolder './devenv' so that your system installation is unaffected.

When the CHANGES log shows that Radian has upgraded to a newer version of one
of its libraries, simply run './make_devenv.sh' again to update your build
environment.

Once you have set up a development environment, the build process depends on 
your operating system. On Linux systems, cd into the './linux' directory and
make as usual. On Mac OS X, open './macosx/radian.xcodeproj' and build, or
use the xcodebuild tool to compile the project. Radian does not use autotools,
so there is no './configure' step.

Regardless of platform, the finished executable will be placed in the root
directory. You may run the validation suite by executing './check'.
