How to install the Xcode language specification files, XCode 3 and later.

For the current user only:
1. Create this folder, if it doesn't already exist:
	mkdir ~/Library/Application\ Support/Shared/Xcode/Specifications

2. Copy in the pbfilespec and pblangspec files:
	cp radian.pb*spec ~/Library/Application\ Support/Shared/Xcode/Specifications/

3. Restart Xcode
	
To install these files for all users on the system, the process is almost the same.

1. Create this folder, if it doesn't already exist:
	mkdir /Library/Application\ Support/Shared/Xcode/Specifications

2. Copy in the pbfilespec and pblangspec files: 
	cp radian.pb*spec /Library/Application\ Support/Shared/Xcode/Specifications/

3. Restart Xcode
